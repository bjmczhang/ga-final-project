### **Step 1: Gather Requirements**

Write down or sketch out what you require to go on to the page, such as the:

- Navigation bar
- Photo of the dish
- Delivery time
- Customize the dish
- Number of dishes to order
- Add to basket button



### **Step 2: Create a frame and grid**

- Open a new Figma file and create a frame.
- Select the iPhone 13 Pro Max – 1.
- Add a 4-column grid with a margin of 25.

### **Step 3: Content block**

- Construct a content block guide, using basic rectangles for each block.

### **Step 4**

- Move these guides out of the frame.

### **Step 5**

- Reduce the width of the guide rectangles. 
- Keep the text as this provides a rough outline of all the content in the wireframe. You will use it as a reference while designing within the frame.

### **Step 6: Header/ Navigation bar**   

**Contents**

- Add a menu icon. A way to navigate to the home screen is to use a hamburger menu to open a side menu as I have used in this example. This helps the user to easily navigate to other pages on the site.

**Note:**  Your navigation does not need to be detailed because it is usually secondary to the wireframe.

- Add a logo so users recognize what site they are on.
- Add a shopping basket as it’s an online delivery service. When the basket is tapped, it opens up a pop-up overlay that allows users to track and alter what they intend to purchase. It also adds an option to check out.  

**Note:** Images are represented as a rectangle with an x through it.

### **Step 7 Placements**

- Add a placement for an image of a dish as a rectangle with an x through it.
- And add a placement for the back button so users can return to the previous page.

### **Step 8: Description** 

- Add a sub-heading for the name of the meal and its price.
- Add body text to give a description.  

**Note:** The wireframe does not have to include details at this point but is added here for demonstrative purposes.

### **Step 9: Delivery**

- Add an icon placement for a vehicle. 
- Add a general time for delivery.
- Add a drop-down menu should a customer require another time for delivery.

- List the options and price.

### **Step 11: Number of dishes required** 

-  Add a plus and minus so users can add or subtract the number of the dish they want to order.

**Step 12: Add to order** 

- Finally, add a button so users can tap to add a dish to their order. 
- And add a text placement displaying the total amount of the dish within this button.
