> #### What is SaaS?
>
> **SaaS** stands for **Software as a Service**. It is a **cloud computing model** where software applications are delivered over the internet on a subscription basis. Instead of installing and maintaining software on individual devices or servers, users can access and use the software **through a web browser**.



## Environment Setup

> #### Shadcn/ui
>
> - Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
>
> - **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
> - It's not a component library, so you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.
> - Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.
> - Shadcn/ui components are not in node modules, they are going to be directly in our components folder so we can modify them in any way we want.



##### 1. Create project

```
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```



##### 2. Run the CLI

```
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

> **CLI** stands for **Command Line Interface**. It is a text-based user interface that allows users to interact with a computer program or operating system by entering commands as text. Instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and menus, a CLI requires users to type specific commands in a terminal or command prompt.



##### 3. Install the components

```
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```



## Folder Setup

##### 1. Set the height for HTML and body

```
// globals.css
html,
body,
:root {
  height: 100%;
}
```



##### 2. Change title and description

```
// layout.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "mAgIc",
  description: "AI Platform",
};
```



##### 3. Router Group

> In the ==app== directory, nested folders are normally mapped to URL paths. However, you can mark a folder as a **Route Group** to prevent the folder from being included in the route's URL path.

A route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: ==(folderName)== 

It's not affecting the URL, it's just a folder where we decided to keep our root page for easier structure.

##### 4. Add authentication to our project

- Shut down our application, so we don't have any hot reloading errors

- Add authentication using clerk

  - install @clerk/nextjs

    ```
    npm install @clerk/nextjs
    ```

  - set environment keys

    ```
    // .env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...
    ```

  - mount clerkprovider

    ```
    // app/layout.tsx
    	...
    import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    	...
    return(
    <ClerkProvider>
    	<html>
            <body>
            ...
            </body>
    	</html>
    </ClerkProvider>
    )
    ```

  - create middleware.ts file

    Now that Clerk is installed and mounted in your application, itâ€™s time to decide which pages are public and which need to hide behind authentication. We do this by creating a ==middleware.ts== file at the root folder (or inside ==src/== if that is how you set up your app).

  - build sign in and sign up pages

    Clerk offers a set of prebuilt components that you can use to embed sign in, sign up, and other user management functions into your Next.js application. 

    ```
    // app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx
    import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    
    export default function Page() {
      return <SignUp />;
    }
    ```

    ```
    // app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx
    import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    
    export default function Page() {
      return <SignIn />;
    }
    ```

  - update environment variables

    add environment variables for the ==signIn== , ==signUp== and ==afterSignUp== , ==afterSignIn== paths:

    ```
    // .env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
    ```

    let clerk knows where to redirect us after we login or where to go in general for sign in and sign up

  - add public route

    ```
    // middleware.ts
    export default authMiddleware({
      publicRoutes: ["/"],
    });
    ```

  - styling sign-in and sign-out page

    ```
    // (auth)/layout.tsx
    const AuthLayout = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
      return (
        <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full">{children}</div>
      );
    };
    
    export default AuthLayout;
    ```

  - embed the <UserButton />

    The ==<UserButton />== allows you to manage your account information and log out, thus allowing you to complete a full authentication circle.

    ```
    // (dashboard)/(routes)/dashboard/page.tsx
    import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    export default function DashboardPage() {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>Dashboard Page (Protected)</p>
          <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
        </div>
      );
    }
    
    ```
