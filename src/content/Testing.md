##### Testing code to ensure 3 things:

- Conciseness
- Clarity
- Repeatability



##### Types of testing:

- e2e (end-to-end) Testing: slow and time consuming
  - WebdriverJS
  - Protractor
  - Cypress

- Integration Testing: faster and cheaper than e2e 
  - React testing library
  - Enzyme
- Unit Testing: faster and cheaper than Integration Testing



# JEST

- JavaScript doesn't have built-in objects or methods that would allow for tests to be written. Therefore, many different libraries have been built to tackle the issue of testing. 

- Jest is a JavaScript testing framework. It's often used for testing code like React, Besides plain JavaScript and React code just allows you to test Babel, TypeScript, Node, Angular, Vue, and various other frameworks. 

- Jest also supports code coverage. **Code coverage** is a measure of what percentage of my code is covered by tests.
